# PrimeFactorization

## Task
A method "prime factorization" is to be created, which receives a number and returns the prime factorization of this number as a product.
**Note:** The prime factorization is the representation of a natural number *n* as a product of prime numbers, which are then referred to as prime factors of n.
Examples:
- 6 = 2 ∙ 3
- 20 = 2 ∙ 2 ∙ 5
