## GoodGrade ##

The certificate grades are calculated at the end of the year.  
Sometimes the question arises whether a good oral grade can result in a better grade.  

## The grades are calculated as follows: ##
Put all school assignments grades 2 times in the "pot", all impromptu task grades 1 time.  
The total is then divided by 2 x (number of school assignments) + (number of impromptu tasks).  
A x.5 grade is rounded down.  

## Task ##
The program should now output all possible oral grades that could lead to an improvement in the certificate grade.  
The grades are entered using the following scheme: 1 2 e 2 3 4.
After entering a character, Return is pressed and the user is prompted to enter the next value.
