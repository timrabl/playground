# Polygon calculation

## General

This document contains two parts:

#### Part 1

The task was as follows:

1. Create a program, which:
    - calculates the bottle and the circumference of a Polygon<sub>n</sub>. [ 0 <= n <= 10 ]
    - asks the user how many corners the Polygon<sub>n</sub> should consist of.
    - asks for each coordinate for the individual points X<sub>n</sub> & Y<sub>n</sub> one after the other.

In the following document it was claimed that to solve this problem P<sub>n</sub>(x<sub>n</sub> / y<sub>n</sub>) must be identical to P<sub>0</sub> (x<sub>0</sub> / y<sub>0</sub>).
If you performed each step of the calculation individually, that would be theoretically correct.
Here, however, it was solved differently for the sake of simplicity.
