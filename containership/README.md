# Containership
The loading of a container ship is to be automated.
the 12 containers should be distributed on the bay (loading bay) with their rows (rows) and tiers (stacking layers) 
in such a way that the weight is as good as possible. 
This is to be done through a program. The ship has exactly 3 rows and 4 tiers in one bay (see sketch with a loading example).
